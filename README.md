*Under heavy development: currently not recommended for use.*

#### What has been done:

* Refactoring of some of the pins, including read/write
* Project structure with existing code ready to be refactored
* First workshop in the new simplified code structure

#### What still needs to be done:

* Refactor the rest of the existing code
* More classes to be added for other components
* Implementation of the remainder of the workshops
